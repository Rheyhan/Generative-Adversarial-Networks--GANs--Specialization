    "### Goal\n",
    "In this notebook, you're going to create another GAN using the MNIST dataset. You will implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), a very successful and influential GAN model developed in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v1.pdf) is the paper if you are interested! It might look dense now, but soon you'll be able to understand many parts of it :)*\n",

    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1.   Get hands-on experience making a widely used GAN: Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN).\n",
    "2.   Train a powerful generative model.\n",
